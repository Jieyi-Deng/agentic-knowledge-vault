## Transcript

[00:05] Hi everyone. Thank you for joining us today for 
prompting 101. Uh my name is Hannah. I'm part
[00:10] of the applied AI team here at Anthropic. And 
with me is Christian, also part of the applied
[00:15] AI team. And what we're going to do today is 
take you through a little bit of prompting best
[00:19] practices. And we're going to use a real world 
scenario and build up a prompt together. Uh so
[00:25] a little bit about what prompt engineering is. uh 
prompt engineering. You're all probably a little
[00:30] bit familiar with this. This is the way that we 
communicate with a language model and try to get
[00:34] it to do what we want. So, this is the practice of 
writing clear instructions for the model, giving
[00:39] the model the context that it needs to complete 
the task, and thinking through how we want to
[00:44] arrange that information in order to get the 
best result. Um, so there's a lot of detail here,
[00:49] a lot of different ways you might want to think 
about building out a prompt. Um, and as always,
[00:53] the best way to learn this is just to practice 
doing it. Um, so today we're going to go through
[00:58] a hands-on scenario. Uh, we're going to use an 
example inspired by a real customer that we worked
[01:03] with. So, we've modified what the actual customer 
asked us to do, but this is a really interesting
[01:08] case of trying to analyze some images and get uh 
factual information out of the images and have
[01:14] Claude make a judgment about what content it finds 
there. And I actually do not speak the language
[01:20] that this content is in, but luckily Christian and 
Claude both do. Uh so I'm going to pass it over
[01:25] to Christian to talk about the scenario and the 
content. So for this example that we have here,
[01:30] it's uh intended so so to set the stage, imagine 
you're working for a Swedish insurance company
[01:35] and you deal with uh car insurance claims on a 
daily manner. Um and the purpose of this is that
[01:41] you have two pieces of information. Um we're going 
to these in detail as well, but visually you can
[01:45] see on the left hand side we have a car accident 
report form. um just detailing out what transpired
[01:52] before the action accident actually took place. 
And then finally, we have a sort of human drawn
[01:57] um sketch of how the accident took place as well. 
So these two pieces of information is what we're
[02:03] going to try to pass on to cloud. And to begin 
with, we could just take these two and throw them
[02:08] into a console and just see what what happens. 
So if we transition over to console as well,
[02:13] we can actually do this in a real manner. And 
in this case here, you can see we have our
[02:17] shiny beautiful entropic console. We're using the 
new claw for solid model as well. In this case,
[02:24] setting temperature zero and having a a huge max 
token budget as well. Just helping us make sure
[02:30] that there's no limitations to what CL can do. In 
this case, you can see I have a very simple prompt
[02:34] just setting the stage of what Cloud's supposed 
to do. in this case mentioning that this is
[02:38] um intend to review a an accident report form uh 
and eventually also determine um what happened
[02:45] in an accident and who's at fault. So you can 
see here with this very simple prompt if I just
[02:49] run this let me go to preview. Uh we can see here 
that Claude thinks that this is in relation to a
[02:58] skiing accident that happened on a street called 
Chappangan. It's a very common street in Sweden.
[03:05] Um and in many ways you can sort of understand 
this innocent mistake in the sense that in our
[03:10] prompt we actually haven't done anything to set 
the stage on what is actually taking place here.
[03:15] So this sort of first guess is not too bad but 
we still notice a lot of intuition that we can
[03:20] bake into cloud. So if we switch back to the 
slides you can see here that um in many ways
[03:27] prompt engineering is a very iterative empirical 
science. Uh in this case here, we could almost
[03:32] have a test case where Claude is supposed to make 
sure it understands it's in a car or vehicular
[03:38] environment, nothing to do with skiing. Uh and in 
that way, you iteratively build upon your prompt
[03:43] to make sure it's actually tackling the problem 
you're intending to solve. Um and to do so,
[03:48] we'll go through some best practices of how we we 
at Anthropic break this down internally and how we
[03:54] recommend others to do so as well. So, we're going 
to talk about some best practices for developing
[03:59] a great prompt. Uh, first we want to talk a 
little bit about what a great prompt structure
[04:04] looks like. So you might be familiar with kind of 
interacting with a chatbot with Claude going back
[04:09] and forth having a more kind of conversational 
style interaction. When we're working with a task
[04:14] like this, we're probably using the API and we 
kind of want to send one single message to Claude
[04:19] and have it nail the task the first time around 
without needing to uh kind of move back and forth.
[04:24] Uh, so the kind of structure that we recommend is 
setting the task description up front. So telling
[04:30] Claude, "What are you here to do? What's your 
role? What task are you trying to accomplish
[04:34] today?" Then we provide content. So in this 
case, it's the images that Christian was showing,
[04:38] the form and the drawing of the accident and how 
they occurred. That's our dynamic content. This
[04:43] might also be something you're retrieving from 
another system, depending on what your use case
[04:47] is. We're going to give some detailed instructions 
to Claude, so almost like a step-by-step list of
[04:52] how we want Claude to go through the task and how 
we want it to um tackle the reasoning. We may give
[04:58] some examples to Claude. Here's an example of some 
piece of content you might receive. Here's how you
[05:03] should respond when given that content. And at 
the end, we usually recommend repeating anything
[05:08] that's really important for Claude to understand 
about this task. Kind of uh reviewing the
[05:12] information with Claude, emphasizing things that 
are extra critical and then telling Claude, "Okay,
[05:17] go ahead and do your work." So, here's another 
view. This has a little bit more detail, a little
[05:23] bit more of a breakdown, and we're going to walk 
through each of these 10 points individually and
[05:27] show you how we build this up, um, in the console. 
So, the first couple things, um, Christian's
[05:33] going to talk about the task context and the tone 
context. Perfect. So, yeah, if we begin with the
[05:38] task context, as you realized when I went through 
a little demo there, um, we didn't have much
[05:43] elaborating what what scenario Chlo was actually 
working within. And because of that, you can also
[05:48] tell that claw doesn't necessarily need to guess a 
lot more on what you actually want from it. So in
[05:53] our case, we really want to break that down, make 
sure we can give more clear-cut instructions. Um,
[05:57] and also make sure we understand what's the 
task that we're asking Claw to do. Um, secondly,
[06:02] as well, we also make sure we add a little bit of 
tone into it all. Um, key thing here is we want
[06:08] Claw to stay factual and to stay confident. So if 
uh, Claw can't understand what it's looking at,
[06:14] we don't want to guess and just sort of mislead 
us. We want to make sure that any assessment
[06:19] and in our case we want to make sure that we can 
understand who's at fault here. We want to make
[06:23] sure that assessment is as clear and as confident 
as possible. If not, we're sort of losing track of
[06:27] what we're doing. So if we transition back to the 
the console, um we can jump to a V2 that we have
[06:34] here. So I'll just navigate to V2. And you can see 
here um I'll also just illustrate the data because
[06:41] we didn't really do that last time around just 
to really highlight what we're looking at. So,
[06:45] what we're seeing here, this is the car accident 
report form, and it's just 17 different checkboxes
[06:51] going through what actually happened. You 
can see there's a vehicle A and vehicle B,
[06:55] both on the left and right hand side. And the main 
purpose of this is that we want to make sure that
[06:58] Claude can understand this manually generated data 
to assess what's actually going on. And that is
[07:05] uh corroborated by if I navigate back here to this 
sketch that we can highlight here as well. In this
[07:11] case, the form is just a different um data point 
for the same scenario. Um and in this case here, I
[07:18] want to bake in more information into our version 
two. Uh and by doing so, I'm actually elaborating
[07:24] a lot more on what's going on. So, you can see 
here I'm specifying that uh this AI assistant is
[07:29] supposed to help a human's claim claims adjuster 
that's reviewing car accident report forms in
[07:34] Swedish as well. Um, you can see here we're also 
elaborating that it's a human-driven sketch of
[07:39] the incident and that you should not um make an 
assessment if it's not actually fully confident.
[07:45] And that's really key because if we run this, 
you'll see that and you can see it's the same
[07:49] settings as well. Clo my new shiny model zero 
temperature as well. If we run this, we can see
[07:54] here what actually happens in this case. Um, CL is 
able to pick up that uh now it's relating to car
[08:02] accidents, not skiing accidents, which is great. 
We can see it's able to pick up that vehicle A was
[08:08] marked on on checkbox one and then vehicle B was 
on 12. Um, and if we scroll down though, we can
[08:13] still tell that there's some information missing 
for claw to make a fully confident determination
[08:19] of who's at fault here. And this is great. This 
is pertaining to a task set. Make sure you don't
[08:24] make anything any claims that aren't um uh factual 
and make sure you you only sort of assess things
[08:30] when you're when you're confident. But there's 
a lot of information we're still missing here.
[08:33] um regarding the form uh what the form actually 
entails and a lot of that information is what
[08:39] we want to want to bake into this LM application 
as well and the best way of doing so is actually
[08:44] adding it to the system prompt which Hannah will 
elaborate on. Um so back in the slides uh we have
[08:50] the next item we're going to add to the prompt 
and this is um background detail data documents
[08:56] and images and here as Christian was saying we 
actually know a lot about this form. the form is
[09:01] going to be the same every single time. The form 
will never change. And so this is a really great
[09:06] type of information to provide to Claude to tell 
Claude, here's the structure of the form you'll
[09:10] be looking at. We know that will not ever alter 
between different queries. The way the form is
[09:15] filled out will change, but the form itself is not 
going to change. And so this is a great type of
[09:20] um information to put into the system prompt. Also 
a great thing to use prompt caching for if you're
[09:25] considering using prompt caching. This will always 
be the same. And what this will help Claude do is
[09:29] spend less time trying to figure out what the form 
is the first time it sees the form each time. And
[09:35] it's going to do a better job of reading the form 
because it already knows um what to expect there.
[09:41] So another thing I want to touch on here is how we 
like to organize information in prompts. So Claude
[09:47] really loves structure, loves organization. 
That's why we recommend following kind of a
[09:51] standard structure in your prompts. And there's 
a couple other tools you can use to help Claude
[09:56] understand the information better. I also just 
want to mention all of this is in our docs with a
[10:01] lot of really great examples. So definitely take 
pictures, but if you forget to take a picture,
[10:05] don't worry. All of this content is online with 
lots of examples and definitely encourage you
[10:10] guys to check it out there too. Um anyway the uh 
so some things you can use delimiters like XML
[10:17] tags also markdown is pretty useful to Claude 
but XML tags are nice because you can actually
[10:23] specify what's inside those tags. So we can tell 
Claude here's here's user preferences. Now you're
[10:29] going to read some content and these XML tags are 
letting you know that everything wrapped in those
[10:33] tags is related to the user's preferences and 
it helps Claude refer back to that information
[10:38] maybe at later points in the prompt. Um, so I 
want to show in the back in the console how we
[10:44] actually do this in this case. And Christian's 
going to pull up our version three. So we're
[10:49] keeping everything about the other part of the 
user prompt the same. And we've decided in this
[10:54] case to put this information in the system prompt. 
You could try this different ways. Uh, we're doing
[10:59] it in the system prompt here. And we're going 
to tell Claude everything it needs to know about
[11:03] this form. So this is a Swedish car accident 
form. The form will be in Swedish. It'll have
[11:07] this title. It'll have two columns. The columns 
represent different vehicles. We'll tell Claude
[11:13] about each of the 17 rows and what they mean. 
You might have noticed when we ran it before,
[11:18] Claude was reading individually each of the lines 
to understand what they are. We can provide all of
[11:23] that information up front. And we're also going 
to give Claude a little bit of information about
[11:27] how this form should be filled out. This is also 
really useful for Claude. We can tell it things
[11:32] like, you know, humans are filling this form 
out basically. So, it's not going to be perfect.
[11:37] People might put a circle. They might scribble. 
They might not put an X in the box. There could
[11:42] be many types of markings that you need to look 
for when you're reading this form. Uh we can also
[11:47] give Claude a little bit of information about how 
to interpret this or what the purpose or meaning
[11:51] of this form is. And all of this is context 
that is hopefully really going to help Claude
[11:56] um do a better job analyzing the form. So if 
we run it, everything else is still the same.
[12:02] So we've kept the same user prompt down here. 
Oh, your scroll is backwards from mine. Uh,
[12:08] the we have the same user prompt here. Still 
asking Claude to do the same task, same context.
[12:14] And we'll see here that it's spending less time. 
It's kind of narrating to us a little bit less
[12:19] about what the form is because it already knows 
what that is. And it's not concerned with kind
[12:23] of bringing us that information back. It's going 
to give us a whole list of what it found to be
[12:28] checked, what the sketch shows. And here Claude 
is now becoming much more confident with this
[12:33] additional context that we gave to Claude. Claude 
now feels it's appropriate to say vehicle B was
[12:39] at fault in this case based on this drawing and 
based on this sketch. So already we're seeing some
[12:44] improvement in the way Claude is analyzing these. 
I think we could probably all agree if we looked
[12:49] at the drawing and at the list that vehicle 
B is at fault. Um so we'd like to see that.
[12:55] Uh so we're going to go back to the slides and 
talk about a couple of other items that we're not
[12:59] really using in this prompt um but can be really 
helpful to building up uh building up your prompt
[13:06] and making it work better. Exactly. I think um 
one thing that we really highlight is examples.
[13:11] I think examples or few shot is a mechanism that 
really is powerful in steering cloud. So you can
[13:18] imagine this um in in quite a non-trivial way as 
well. So imagine you have scenarios, situations,
[13:25] even in this case concrete accidents that have 
happened that are um tricky for claw to get right.
[13:31] But you with your human intuition and your human 
label data um is able to actually get to the right
[13:37] conclusion. Then you can bake that information 
into the system problem itself by having clear-cut
[13:42] examples of a the data that that it's supposed 
to look at. So you can have visual examples.
[13:47] you can just base 64 encode a a an image and have 
that as part of the data that you're passing along
[13:53] into the examples and then on top of that you can 
have the sort of depiction or description rather
[13:58] of how to break that down and understand it. This 
is something we really highlight and and emphasize
[14:02] in how you can sort of push the limits of your 
LLM application is by baking in these examples
[14:08] into system prompt. And this again is sort of the 
empirical science of prompt engineering that you
[14:12] sort of always want to push the limits of your 
application and get that feedback loop in where
[14:17] it's going wrong and try to add that into system 
prompt so that next time when example that sort
[14:21] of mimics that u takes place it's able to actually 
reference it in its example set. You can see here
[14:27] as well, this is just a little example of how we 
do this. Again, really emphasizing the sort of XML
[14:34] structure that we we um we enjoy. It's it gives a 
lot of structure to the clone. It's what it's been
[14:38] fine-tuned on as well. Um and it works perfectly 
well for this example. And in our case, we're not
[14:43] doing this just because it's a simple demo, 
but you can realistically imagine if you were
[14:47] building this for an insurance company, you'd have 
tens, maybe even hundreds of examples are quite
[14:52] difficult, maybe in the gray, that you'd like to 
make sure that Claude actually has some basis in
[14:57] to make the verdict next time. Um, another topic 
we really want to highlight, which we're not doing
[15:02] in this demo, is conversation history. It's in the 
same vein as examples. uh we use this to make sure
[15:08] that the enough context rich information is at 
close disposal when it when when closing on on on
[15:15] your behalf. Um in our case now this isn't really 
a userfacing LLM application. It's more something
[15:21] happening in the background. You can imagine for 
this insurance company they have this automated
[15:25] system some data is generated out of this and then 
you might have a human in the loop at towards the
[15:29] end. If you were have to build something much more 
userf facing where you'd have a long conversation
[15:34] history that would be um relevant to bring in this 
is a perfect place in the system prompt to include
[15:40] because it enriches the context that Claude works 
within. Um in our case we haven't done so but what
[15:47] we do is and the next step is try to make sure 
we give a concrete reminder of the task at hand.
[15:55] So, now we're going to build out the 
final part of this prompt for Claude,
[15:59] and that's coming back to the reminder of what 
the immediate task is and giving Claude a reminder
[16:03] about any important guidelines that we want it 
to follow. Some reasons that we may do this are
[16:09] a preventing hallucinations. Um, so we want Claude 
to uh not invent details that it's not finding in
[16:16] this prompt, right? Or not finding in the data. 
If Claude can't tell which form is checked,
[16:21] we don't want Claude to take its best guess or 
invent the idea that a box might be checked when
[16:26] it's not. If the sketch is unintelligible, the 
person did a really bad job drawing this drawing
[16:32] and even a human would not be able to figure it 
out. We want Claude to be able to say that. And
[16:36] so these are some of the things we'll include in 
this final reminder and kind of wrap up step for
[16:41] Claude. Uh remind it to do things like answer only 
if it's very confident. We could even ask it to
[16:46] refer back to what it has seen in the form anytime 
it's making a factual claim. So if it wants to say
[16:52] vehicle B turned right, it should say I know this 
based on the fact that box two is clearly checked
[16:57] or whatever it might be. We can kind of give 
Claude some guidelines about that. So if we go
[17:01] back to the console, we can see the next version 
of the prompt and we're going to keep uh we're
[17:09] going to keep everything the same here in the 
system prompt. So, we're not changing any of that
[17:13] background context that we gave to Claude about 
the form, about how it's going to fill everything
[17:17] out. We're not changing anything else about the 
context and the role. We're just adding this
[17:22] detailed list of tasks. And this is how we want 
Claude to go about analyzing this. And a really
[17:27] key thing that we found here as we were building 
this demo and when we were working on the customer
[17:31] example is that the order in which Claude analyzes 
this information is very important. And this is
[17:36] analogous to way you might think about doing this. 
If you were a human, you would probably not look
[17:41] at the drawing first and try to understand what 
was going on, right? It's pretty unclear. It's
[17:45] a bunch of boxes and lines. We don't really know 
what that drawing is supposed to mean without any
[17:50] additional context. But if we have the form and we 
can read the form first and understand that we're
[17:55] talking about a car accident and that we're seeing 
some checkboxes that indicate what vehicles we're
[17:59] doing at certain times, then we know a little 
bit more about how to understand what might be
[18:04] in the drawing. And so that's the kind of detail 
that we're going to give Claude here is to say,
[18:08] "Hey, first go look at the form. Look at it very 
carefully. Make sure you can tell what boxes are
[18:13] checked. Make sure you're not missing anything 
here. Um, make a list for yourself of what you see
[18:19] in that. And then move on to the sketch. So after 
you've kind of confidently gotten information
[18:24] out of the form and you can say what's factually 
true, then you can go on and think about what you
[18:30] can gain from that sketch. keeping in mind your 
understanding of the accident so far. So, whatever
[18:36] you've learned from the form, you're trying to 
match that up with the sketch. And that's how
[18:40] you're going to arrive um at your final uh at your 
final assessment of the form. And we'll run it.
[18:52] And here you can see one behavior that 
this produced for Claude because I told
[18:56] it to very carefully examine the form. It's 
showing me its work as it does that. So,
[19:01] it's telling me each individual box. Is the box 
checked? Is it not checked? And so, this is one
[19:06] thing you'll notice as you do prompt engineering. 
In our previous prompts, we were kind of letting
[19:11] claw decide how much it wanted to tell us about 
what it saw on the form here. Because I've told
[19:16] it carefully examine each and every box, it's very 
carefully examining each and every box. And that
[19:21] might not be what we want in the end. So, that's 
something we might change. Um, but it's also going
[19:26] to give me these other things that I asked for 
in XML tags. So, a nice analysis of the form, the
[19:32] accident summary so far. It's going to give me a 
sketch analysis, and it's going to continue to say
[19:37] that vehicle B appears to be clearly at fault. In 
this in this example, it's pretty simple example
[19:42] with more complicated drawings, more uh less 
clarity in the forms. This kind of step-by-step
[19:48] thinking for Claude is really impactful in 
its ability to make a correct assessment here.
[19:54] Uh, so I think we'll go back to the slides and 
Christian's going to talk about a last kind of
[19:59] piece that we might add to this um to really make 
it useful for a real world task. Indeed. Thank
[20:05] you so much. So, as Hannah mentioned, uh, we sort 
of set the stage in this prompt to make sure that
[20:11] really acting on our behalf in a right manner. 
Um, and a key step that we also add towards the
[20:16] end of this prompt that I'm going to show you in a 
second is a simple sort of guidelines or reminder
[20:21] part as well. just strengthening and reinforcing 
exactly what we want to get out of it. And one
[20:26] important piece is actually output formatting. 
You can imagine if you're a data engineer working
[20:30] on this LM application, all the sort of fancy 
preamble is great, but at the end of the day,
[20:35] you want your piece of information to to 
be stored in, let's say, your SQL database,
[20:39] wherever you want to store that data. And the rest 
of it that is necessary for cloud to sort of give
[20:44] its verdict isn't really that necessary for your 
application. You want the nitty-gritty information
[20:49] for your application. So if we transition back to 
the console, you'll see here that we just added
[20:54] a simple importance guidelines part. And again, 
this is just reinforcing the sort of mechanical
[21:01] behavior that we want out of cloud here. Want 
to make sure that the summary is clear, concise,
[21:06] and accurate. Want to make sure that nothing 
is sort of impeding in in in Claw's assessment
[21:11] apart from the data it's analyzing. And then 
finally, when it comes to output formatting,
[21:15] in my case here, I'm just going to ask Claude 
to wrap its final verdict. All other stuff I'm
[21:20] actually going to ignore for my application and 
just look at what it's actually assessing. And
[21:24] that is I can I can use this if I want to build 
some sort of analytics tool afterwards as well.
[21:29] Or if I just want a clearcut um uh determination, 
this is a way I can do so. So if I just run this
[21:35] here, you'll see it's going through the same sort 
of process that we've seen before. In this case,
[21:39] it's much more succinct because we've asked 
to be to summarize its findings in a much
[21:43] more straightforward manner. And then finally 
towards the end you'll see that it'll wrap my
[21:48] output in these final verdict XML tags. So you 
can see that during this demo we've gone from
[21:54] a skiing accident to sort of unconfident insecure 
outputs from perhaps a car accident in the second
[22:01] version to now a much more strictly formatted 
confident output that we can actually build an
[22:08] application around and actually help you know a 
real world um car insurance company for example.
[22:15] U finally if we transition back to the um slides 
another key way of shaping CL's output is actually
[22:24] putting words in CL's mouth or as we call it 
pre-filled responses. You could imagine that
[22:30] parsing XML tags is nice and all but maybe you 
want a structured JSON output to make sure that
[22:36] uh it's JSON serializable and you can use this 
in a subse subsequent call for example. Um this
[22:42] is quite simple to do. You could just add that um 
claude needs to begin its output with a certain
[22:48] format. This could be for example a uh open 
square bracket squarely bracket for example
[22:53] or even in this case that we see in front of us 
this would be an XML tag for itinerary. In our
[22:58] case it could also be that final verdict XML tag. 
Um, and this is just a great way of again shaping
[23:04] how Claude is supposed to respond. Um, without all 
the preamble if you don't want that, even though
[23:09] that is also key in shaping his output to make 
sure that Claude is reasoning through the steps
[23:14] that we wanted. So in our case here, we would just 
wrap it in the final verdict and then parse it
[23:18] afterwards. But you can use prefill as well. Now 
finally one step that I would like to highlight
[23:24] here as well is that both cloud 3.7 and especially 
cloud 4 of course is a sort of hybrid reasoning
[23:31] model meaning that there's extended thinking at 
your disposal. Um and this is something we want
[23:36] to highlight because you can use extended thinking 
as a crutch for your prompt engineering. Basically
[23:41] you can enable this to make sure that Claude 
actually has time to think. It adds his thinking
[23:45] tags and the scratch pad. Um and the beauty of 
that is you can actually analyze that transcript
[23:50] to understand how claude is going about that data. 
So as we mentioned we have these check boxes where
[23:55] it goes through step by step of the scenario 
that transpired for the accident. And in many
[24:00] ways there you can actually try to help claude in 
building this into the system prompt itself. It's
[24:04] not only more token efficient but it's a good way 
of understanding how these intelligent models that
[24:10] don't have our intuition actually go about the 
data that we provide them. And because of that,
[24:14] it's quite key in actually trying to break down 
how your system prompt can get a lot better. Um,
[24:19] and with that said, I think uh I'd like to thank 
all you for coming today. We'll be around as well.
[24:24] So if you have any questions on prompting, please 
uh please go ahead. I know there's a prompting.
[24:29] You want to learn more about prompting in an hour. 
We have prompting for agents and right now we
[24:34] have an amazing demo of Claude plays Pokemon. So 
don't go anywhere for that. And as Christian said,
[24:39] we'll be around all day. So, I know we 
didn't have time for Q&A in this session,
[24:42] but uh please come find us if you want to chat. 
And thank you guys for coming. Thank you so much.
